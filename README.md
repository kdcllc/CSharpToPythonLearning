## Key Differences and Similarities Between C# and Python

- **Syntax**: Python's syntax is more concise and readable compared to C#. Indentation is significant in Python.
- **Type System**: Python is dynamically typed, whereas C# is statically typed.
- **Memory Management**: Both languages use garbage collection, but Python's memory management is more automated.
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries for data science, web development, and more.

## Advanced Topics

- **Performance Optimization**: Strategies for profiling and optimizing Python code.
- **Concurrency**: Using `asyncio`, threading, and multiprocessing in Python.
- **Integration**: Interfacing Python with C# and other languages.

## Tooling and Best Practices

- **Virtual Environments**: Use `venv` or `virtualenv` to manage dependencies.
- **Package Management**: Use `pip` for installing packages and `pipenv` or `poetry` for managing dependencies.
- **Code Quality**: Tools like `flake8`, `pylint`, and `black` for linting and formatting.
- **Testing**: Frameworks like `unittest`, `pytest`, and `nose` for writing tests.

## Linux Ubuntu DevBox Setup

Ubuntu 22.04 comes with Python `3.10.12`.

### How to Install and Manage Other Versions of Python Interpreters

The default Python interpreter is located at `/usr/bin/python3`.

#### Display All Installed Dependencies

To list all installed Python dependencies, use the following command:

```bash
apt list --installed | grep python
```

### Installing Multiple Versions of Python and Switching Between Them

[`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is a utility for managing multiple Python versions, similar to [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for Node.js.

An alternative method is to use `apt`:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.5
```

### Install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)

#### Install Dependencies

This script installs the necessary dependencies and clones the `pyenv` repository.

```bash
# Prerequisites
sudo apt install libedit-dev
sudo apt uninstall python3-pip
sudo apt-get install build-essential zlib1g-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev liblzma-dev
sudo apt-get install python-tk python3-tk tk-dev
```

#### Install `pyenv`

```bash
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

#### Update `~/.bashrc` File

Add the following lines to the end of your `~/.bashrc` file to initialize `pyenv`:

```bash
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
[[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"

# Build Location
export TMPDIR="$HOME/.pyenv-tmp"

# Load Virtualenv
# Load pyenv-virtualenv automatically by adding
# the following to ~/.bashrc:
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
```

#### Install the Latest Version of Python

```bash
pyenv install --list | grep " 3\.[12]"

# Downloads and builds the specified version
pyenv install 3.12.3

# List installed versions
pyenv versions

# Set global Python version
pyenv global 3.12.3
```

[pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv)

### Install Aider or Poetry Virtual Environments

Once you have multiple Python versions running, you may need to set up global dependencies for your projects.

#### Aider

[aider](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider) is a tool for managing virtual environments.

```bash
# Create an environment
pyenv virtualenv 3.12.3 aider

# Display newly created environment
pyenv versions

# Activate the environment
pyenv activate aider

# Deactivate the environment
pyenv deactivate

# Install aider
pip install aider-chat

# Display the number of installed packages
pip freeze | wc -l
```

By default, auto-commit changes are enabled. To override the default, add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` file:

```bash
export AIDER_AUTO_COMMITS=0
```

To add this automatically from a bash command, you can use the following script:

```bash
echo 'export AIDER_AUTO_COMMITS=0' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

```bash
#OLLAMA_API_BASE=http://localhost:11434/

# https://aider.chat/docs/llms.html#azure
# aider --model azure/gpt-4-32k --no-auto-commits

AZURE_API_KEY=
AZURE_API_VERSION=
AZURE_API_BASE=


# https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider/issues/596

# https://aider.chat/docs/llms.html#ollama
# export OLLAMA_API_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:11434
# aider --model ollama/mistral:latest
# aider --model ollama/codellama:7b --no-auto-commits
```
#### Poetry

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is another tool for dependency management and packaging in Python.

```bash
# Create an environment
pyenv virtualenv 3.12.3 poetry

# Display newly created environment
pyenv versions

# Activate the environment
pyenv activate poetry

# Deactivate the environment
pyenv deactivate

# Install Poetry
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python -

# Configure Poetry to create virtual environments inside the project directory
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true

# Create a new Poetry project
poetry new my-project

# Navigate to the project directory
cd my-project

# Add dependencies
poetry add requests

# Activate the virtual environment
poetry shell

# Deactivate the virtual environment
exit
```

### Additional Useful Commands

#### Updating Python Packages

To update all installed Python packages, use the following command:

```bash
pip list --outdated | grep -v '^\-e' | cut -d ' ' -f1 | xargs -n1 pip install -U
```

#### Uninstalling Python Packages

To uninstall a Python package, use the following command:

```bash
pip uninstall <package_name>
```

#### Creating and Managing Virtual Environments with `venv`

To create a virtual environment using `venv`, use the following command:

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
```

To activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

To deactivate the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

#### Checking Python Version

To check the current Python version, use the following command:

```bash
python --version
```

#### Basic Git Commands

To initialize a new Git repository:

```bash
git init
```

To clone an existing repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

To check the status of your repository:

```bash
git status
```

To add changes to the staging area:

```bash
git add <file_name>
```

To commit changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

To push changes to a remote repository:

```bash
git push origin <branch_name>
```
